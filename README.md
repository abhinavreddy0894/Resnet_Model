# Resnetmini
This project implements a simplified version of a ResNet-like architecture, referred to as ResNetMini, to explore the effects of the vanishing gradient problem in deep learning models. The focus is on demonstrating how problematic activation functions, such as Sigmoid, can exacerbate this issue in residual connections.
# About Dataset
The model is trained and evaluated on a subset of the Imagenette dataset, a smaller and more manageable dataset derived from ImageNet, using a PyTorch implementation. A subset of 10 images is selected randomly for demonstration purposes. Additionally, the program visualizes gradient magnitudes in the network, providing insights into how the vanishing gradient problem affects training.
